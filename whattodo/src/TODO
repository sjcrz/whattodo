What will this look like: 

Home page: What task should I be doing right now??

Task input: Name, description (optional), due date (optional), estimated hours (estimated)
Then, arrange it into the priority queue

Event input: Name, description (optional), date, recurrance (optional)
- Regular events: breakfast, lunch, dinner, sleep (have them already there)
- Other events: scheduled via the UI

Frontend views: 
- Homepage: pomodoro page displaying what you should be working on and scheduling breaks
- Time block page: view your scheduled tasks/events in a time block grid 
- Task input page
    - Input UI
    - Sort by priority
    - Sort by due date
- Event input page (maybe have a gcal importer for this?)
    - Input UI 
    - Calendar view

Backend: 
- Scheduler
    - Greedy - try to do tasks as soon as possible in order of priority 
    - Lets you know if you won't be finishing in time, will sacrifice lower priority tasks to make time 
- Input receiver
    - Send to db
- Event receiver
    - Send to db 
- Database diagram - mongo for this since many optional params?
